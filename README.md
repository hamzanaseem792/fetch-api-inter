Welcome to the Random User Info Fetcher! This project demonstrates how to handle and manipulate JSON data using vanilla JavaScript and its asynchronous features. By clicking the button, you fetch data of a random person from the Random User Generator API. The fetched information includes the userâ€™s name, address, email, date of birth, and a profile picture.

The project employs async/await to handle asynchronous operations, making the code clean and easy to understand. Explore and see how modern JavaScript handles data fetching and manipulation!
